    <p>Veggie lasagna was always something that my mum would make for us growing up and it felt like a real treat. When I could choose what to have for tea on my birthday veggie lasagna is always what I would choose. This recipe is heavily inspired by the one she made growing up but with a few of my own touches.</p>

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <h4>Tomato Sauce</h4>
        <li>Dice the onion and crush the garlic or cut into small pieces. Fry for about 15 minutes or until the onion is soft. Adding a small amount of water to the pan can help speed up the cooking process.</li>
        <li>If using carrot and celery then chop these into small pieces and add to the onions about 5 minutes into the cooking time. Adding celery and carrot can add some extra flavour but if you don't like them then feel free to skip.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato puree, vegetable stock cube and the dried basil add let the sauce simmer for at least 30 minutes, while you are working on the cheese sauce</li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 180 degrees</li>
        <h4>Cheese Sauce</h4>
        <li>Melt the butter in a saucepan</li>
        <li>Add the flour and whisk together until a thick paste is formed</li>
        <li>Slowly add the milk about a fifth of a pint at a time and work the sauce together each time using the whisk, making sure to remove any lumps</li>
        <li>Once all the milk has been combined keep the sauce on a low heat, stirring until it thickens up</li>
        <li>Once the sauce has thickened up add the cheese and stir until it has melted into the sauce</li>
        <h4>Combining the Lasagna</h4>
        <li>Combine the lasagna</li>
    </ol>
